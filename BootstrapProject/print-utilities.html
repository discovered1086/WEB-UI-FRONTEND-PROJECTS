    <!--row and container are predefined bootstrap classes
                            - A conatiner consists of unlimited rows-->

    <!--Every row consists of columns and every row consists of 12 columns, not one
                            more, not one less-->
    <!-- Columns can be equal width declared as col, can be auto width declared as col-auto,
                            can be fixed width of number of columns specified by col-<number of columns> ex col-7
                            and then finally columns can also be declared for fixed width along with the break point.

                            col -> equal width
                            col-auto -> auto width
                            col-<number of columns> -> fixed width without break point
                            col-<device-size>-<number of columns> -> fixed width with break point
                            The important thing to remember is that different kinds of column declarations can
                            be combined to build a row-->

    <!--Here we exercise 4 classes
    They're very useful when you want to specify how the pages should look
    when someone is trying to print the page
    
    1. visible-print-block says, the content surrounded by this class
    will only be visible when someone attempts to print the page, and it would appear in a block style
    
    2. visible-print-inline says, the content surrounded by this class
    will only be visiable when the page is attempted to be printed, and it it would appear in
    inline style
    
    3. visible-print-inline-block says, the content surrounded by this class
    will only be visiable when the page is attempted to be printed, and it it would appear in
    inline-block style  
    
    4.hidden-print says, this content would not be visible when the page is attempted
    to be printed
    
    Here the difference between the block and inline styles aren't visible because I have
    used paragraphs for all of them but for links, buttons, series of buttons etc, this would
    make more sense
