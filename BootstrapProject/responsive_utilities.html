    <!--row and container are predefined bootstrap classes
                            - A conatiner consists of unlimited rows-->

    <!--Every row consists of columns and every row consists of 12 columns, not one
                            more, not one less-->
    <!-- Columns can be equal width declared as col, can be auto width declared as col-auto,
                            can be fixed width of number of columns specified by col-<number of columns> ex col-7
                            and then finally columns can also be declared for fixed width along with the break point.

                            col -> equal width
                            col-auto -> auto width
                            col-<number of columns> -> fixed width without break point
                            col-<device-size>-<number of columns> -> fixed width with break point
                            The important thing to remember is that different kinds of column declarations can
                            be combined to build a row-->

    <!--Now we're going to practice responsive utilities concept which shows and hides contents based on the
    device sizes-->

    than the break point specified, the content will disappear

    <!--One very important this to be noticed here is that it's useless using the below classes
    1. hidden-xs-up
    2. hidden-xl-down
