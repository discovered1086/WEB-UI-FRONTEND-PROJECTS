    <!--row and container are predefined bootstrap classes
                            - A conatiner consists of unlimited rows-->

    <!--Every row consists of columns and every row consists of 12 columns, not one
                            more, not one less-->
    <!-- Columns can be equal width declared as col, can be auto width declared as col-auto,
                            can be fixed width of number of columns specified by col-<number of columns> ex col-7
                            and then finally columns can also be declared for fixed width along with the break point.

                            col -> equal width
                            col-auto -> auto width
                            col-<number of columns> -> fixed width without break point
                            col-<device-size>-<number of columns> -> fixed width with break point
                            The important thing to remember is that different kinds of column declarations can
                            be combined to build a row-->

    <!--Now we're going to practice the grid inside grid feature. Here we can include one grid inside
                           another grid. Just like the parent and child div and span relationships go in plain html, css-->
